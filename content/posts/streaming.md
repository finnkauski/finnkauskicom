# Hey folks!

I recently got the urge to stream myself coding and programming. I am a keen
learner and recently have been learning more and more Rust as a language for my
hobbies and as an opportunity to develop.

[Click here](https://www.twitch.tv/finnkauski) to see my twitch profile and read
on for the content that is coming up in the near future.

# Upcoming content

The short term project I will be working towards is creating an app that
connects my `midi` drums to my hue lights! Ultimately I want to compile it to
[WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/) which is going to be quite fun!

I already started this and have basic interactivity with my lights now from Rust
so if you tune in to the streams we'll be working on:

- wrapping up the interaction with the lights into a command line tool to share
  with others
- figuring out the connectivity from the drums to the computer using the `midi`
  protocol
- coming up with fun interactions we can do from the drumkit to the lights
- wrapping all of this in both a command line tool and a web UI using
  [WebAssembly](https://webassembly.org/)

Optionally if people do sound interested we'll do a session on going through
the [Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) so people can get up to speed
on what the hell RustLang is and more or less what is happening on the stream.
