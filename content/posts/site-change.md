# Hey folks!

Just decided to give you a shout that the page has gotten a bit of a facelift.
I am currently using `hugo` (great framework) to develop and deploy my pages.

I will writing up a nice little post about it in a few days.

# Other upcoming content

So I have asked people to write a few post for me. In the near future I will put
up:

0. Review and small taster blog on `dask` (python related)
1. My experiences with Haskell (oh boy!)
1. A song of praise for Doom-Emacs
   - or "How I stopped jumping around IDE's and fell in love with Emacs"

So if any of that interests you, keep an eye out.
