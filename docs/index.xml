      <description>The Setup First of climate change is an insanely scary issue for everyone and should not be neglected! However, I want to talk about a different environment, a python environment.
I recently got asked to talk about my environment management when I work in python. However if that person had read my first post on this page they would have noticed:
 &amp;ldquo;Pipenv: The Future of Python Dependency Management&amp;rdquo; - A splendid talk about how not to have a breakdown trying to run your python code on other peoples computers (aka sharing projects and proper dependency management)</description>

      <description>Oh boy, where do we even start.
My colleague, an ardent mathematician, kept telling me about functional programming for what basically is my whole programming life. I come from an economist background so for me the terms Object-Oriented and functional did not mean much. Also, I think early on in our journeys on the path to learn how to write code we don&#39;t concern ourselves with paradigms (which is what those terms meant).</description>

      <description>Intro Today I&#39;ll focus on python.
As I am sure you will know that python is a general purpose programming language which is a commonly used tool to build data science pipelines, models etc.
The following will be a few resources to watch and read that I believe to be worth your time. And below that you&#39;ll a personality spotlight with a few good names in the python community that I would like to highlight.</description>

      <description>Intro What is this about then?
Well, during a recent interview I decided that is probably worth starting up a blog or a newsletter of some kind. So this is the attempt at it.
The goal here will be two-fold.
 Get better at writing for the web Dump my knowledge of things I learn regularly for sharing purposes  Content The content here will vary. I think this will first and foremost be a dumping ground of resources for people wanting to learn Data Science, Programming etc.</description>
