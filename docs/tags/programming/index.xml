      <description>DRUE This is a showcase of a bit of software I&#39;ve been writing. I am a newbie drummer and wanted to spice up some practice with a light show so this links the lights in my room (Philips HUE bulbs) with my drumkit.
I haven&#39;t opened the repository for the codebase yet. But if there is demand I will tidy it up and put it on github.
Demo:   A few things to note I only show you 2 &amp;lsquo;modes&amp;rsquo; that I&#39;ve implemented:</description>

      <description>Hey folks! I recently got the urge to stream myself coding and programming. I am a keen learner and recently have been learning more and more Rust as a language for my hobbies and as an opportunity to develop.

Upcoming content The short term project I will be working towards is creating an app that connects my midi drums to my hue lights!</description>

      <description>The Setup First of climate change is an insanely scary issue for everyone and should not be neglected! However, I want to talk about a different environment, a python environment.
I recently got asked to talk about my environment management when I work in python. However if that person had read my first post on this page they would have noticed:
 &amp;ldquo;Pipenv: The Future of Python Dependency Management&amp;rdquo; - A splendid talk about how not to have a breakdown trying to run your python code on other peoples computers (aka sharing projects and proper dependency management)</description>

      <description>Oh boy, where do we even start.
My colleague, an ardent mathematician, kept telling me about functional programming for what basically is my whole programming life. I come from an economist background so for me the terms Object-Oriented and functional did not mean much. Also, I think early on in our journeys on the path to learn how to write code we don&#39;t concern ourselves with paradigms (which is what those terms meant).</description>

      <description>Intro Today I&#39;ll focus on python.
As I am sure you will know that python is a general purpose programming language which is a commonly used tool to build data science pipelines, models etc.
The following will be a few resources to watch and read that I believe to be worth your time. And below that you&#39;ll a personality spotlight with a few good names in the python community that I would like to highlight.</description>
