      <description>TLDR; I&#39;ve been working on a new project recently which focuses on controlling Philips Hue lights from the command line. Did it because was not happy with the other CLI I used before.

Demo:   A few things to note I only show you 2 &amp;lsquo;modes&amp;rsquo; that I&#39;ve implemented:</description>
